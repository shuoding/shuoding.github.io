    <h2>Relevant Projects</h2>
    <h3>Formalizing Featherweight X10 using Coq (Written in Coq)</h3>
    <p>Featherweight X10 (FX10) is a parallel programming language that can fork tasks and then await their completion in a syntactically structured manner. <br>
       We defined inductive types representing the syntax of FX10 and binary relations encoding the steps-to semantics,<br>
       and proved a progress theorem, which implies the absence of deadlocks.
    </p>
    <h3>Uniform Program Generation (Written in C++)</h3>
    <p>Implemented a program generator that can generate programs based on the context free grammar in a uniform way,<br>
       meaning that the generator can analyze the grammar and adjust the generation process accordingly
    </p>
    <h3>SFPL Interpreter (Written in Haskell)</h3>
    <p>Designed and implemented a dynamically-typed functional programming language called SFPL (Small Functional Programming Language),<br>
       which supports integer arithmetic and comparison, function definitions and function calls with lexical scoping,<br>
       recursive functions, higher order functions, the pair data structure, and basic integer input and output
    </p>
    <h3>Tiger Compiler (Written in Java and C++)</h3>
    <p>Implemented several main parts of a compiler for a simple imperative programming lanugage called Tiger</p>
