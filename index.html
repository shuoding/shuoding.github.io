		<p>My name is Shuo Ding. I'm in the process of obtaining my PhD in computer science (2020 - present) at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gatech.edu/">Georgia Tech</a>. Prior to that, I obtained a bachelor's degree in math from <a target="_blank" href="http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/">Xi'an Jiaotong University</a> and a master's degree in computer science from Georgia Tech.</p>
		<p>My area (in a broad sense) is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory">programming language theory</a>. I mainly focus on two aspects: (1) specific <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_analysis">program analysis</a> techniques, and (2) fundamental limitations of program analysis (such as the famous <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice%27s_theorem">Rice's theorem</a>), <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)">syntax</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantics_(computer_science)">semantics</a> of programming languages, and <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_computation">theory of computation</a>. I'm also broadly interested in programming paradigms, formal methods, mathematical logic, philosophy, and linguistics.</p>

		      <summary>The Study of Formal Reasoning (Click to Expand)</summary>
		      <p>I'm maintaining a collection of keywords about the fundamental facts and limits of formal reasoning, both for human mind (mathematical logic) and for computers (theory of computation). Those two areas are closely connected to each other. The keywords include areas, concepts, theorems, etc., and if you are interested in them you can search them on the Internet and probably find some explanations and tutorials. I plan to add more concrete keywords and organize them into a clean table in the future.</p>
		      <details>
			      <summary>Mathematical Logic (Click to Expand)</summary>
			      <p>syntax and semantics of formal logic (propositional logic, first-order logic, higher-order logic, etc.), model theory (finite model theory, etc.), proof theory (structural proof theory, proof complexity, automated reasoning, etc.), computability theory (primitive recursive functions, recursive functions, the halting problem, computable sets, computably enumerable sets, the s-m-n theorem, Kleene's recursion theorem, many-one degrees, Turing degrees, the arithmetical hierarchy, the analytical hierarchy, etc.), set theory (ZFC, cardinals and ordinals, descriptive set theory, forcing, etc.), type theory (the lambda cube, Martin-Loef's type theory, homotopy type theory, cubical type theory, etc.), Goedel's completeness theorem, Goedel's first and second incompleteness theorems (Goedel numbering), Tarski's undefinability theorem, etc.</p>

		      <details>
			      <summary>Theory of Computation (Click to Expand)</summary>
			      <p>automata theory (DFA, NFA, PDA, Buechi automata, etc.), formal language theory (pumping lemmas, the Chomsky hierarchy, the Chomsky-Schuetzenberger representation theorem, etc.), models of computation (Turing machines, lambda calculus, recursive functions, etc.), computability theory (mentioned above), computational complexity theory (complexity classes (P, NP, coNP, etc.), Savitch's theorem, the polynomial hierarchy, Kolmogorov complexity, proof complexity, descriptive complexity, geometric complexity theory (whose goal is to answer the famous "whether P = NP" problem), Blum axioms, etc.), syntax and semantics of programming languages (denotational semantics (game semantics, categorical semantics, etc.), operational semantics (small-step semantics and big-step semantics), axiomatic semantics (Hoare logic, etc.), etc.), program reasoning (formal aspects of program analysis, verification, and synthesis), logic in computer science (the Curry-Howard correspondence, and something mentioned above, etc.), category theory, etc.</p>
