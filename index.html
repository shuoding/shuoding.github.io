    <h2>Research Interests in Computer Science</h2>
    <p>I'm widely interested in programming languages. I particularly like programming language design and implementation, type theory and type systems, and static program analysis.</p>
    <p>Theoretical things attract me most, but I also think applying theoretical results to the real industry is important and exciting.</p>

    <h2>Selected Projects in Computer Science</h2>
    <h3>Tiger Compiler (Written in Java and C++)</h3>
    <p>Implemented the main parts (lexer and parser, optimizer on the IR, instruction selection and register allocation for MIPS32) of a compiler for a simple imperative programming lanugage called Tiger.</p>
    <h3>SFPL Interpreter (Written in Haskell)</h3>
    <p>Designed a dynamically-typed functional programming language called SFPL (Small Functional Programming Language), which supports basic integer arithmetic operations, function definitions and function calls with lexical scoping, recursive functions, higher order functions, the pair data structure, and basic integer input and output</p>
    <p>Implemented SFPL in Haskell as an interpreter</p>
    <h3>Formalizing Featherweight X10 using Coq (Written in Coq, in Progress)</h3>
    <p>Featherweight X10 is a small parallel programming language based on the real X10 language. Its primary features are the ability to fork tasks and then await their completion in a syntactically structured manner.</p>
    <p>The goal of this project is to formalize Featherweight X10. Specifically, we will define inductive types representing the syntax of FX10 and binary relations encoding the steps-to semantics, and prove a progress theorem, which implies the absence of deadlocks.</p>

    <h2>Other Experience in Computer Science</h2>
    <p>Silver Medal, 2016 ACM-ICPC China Shaanxi Provincial Programming Contest</p>
    <p>I occasionally solve problems and participate contests in LeetCode, just for fun. Here is my LeetCode <a href="https://leetcode.com/iomonad/" title="Shuo Ding" target="_blank">profile</a>.</p>
