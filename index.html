  <h2>The Code Quality In The Academia</h2>
  <p>Recently, I did some work relating to the academic research in the 
system area in computer science. In this area, people do experiments to 
demostrate that their ideas really work. I agree that experiments are 
necessary. In fact, since modern systems are complex, it is very hard to 
model complex systems theoretically. Thus, the best way to test an idea 
is to implement it and do experiments to test its effects. </p>
  <p>Unfortunately, the source code quality in the academia world is 
generally not good. In my opinion, there are two reasons for this 
phenomenon. First, I guess sometimes the deadlines of publishing papers force 
people to work quickly, so people may just rely on source code that 
works but not beautiful, because what people care is demostrating their 
ideas by experiments, which does not require source code of high quality. 
Second, I guess that after the publication of the paper, people in the 
academia world will not spend time on maintaining the source code, because 
generally that source code will not be used in the future. </p>
  <p>I don't have enough experience in the system area, and for other areas 
in computer science, I haven't really enter the doors. But, I guess that 
this phenomenon is common in the academia. I don't think this is a good 
phenomenon. Although people care about the demostration of ideas instead of 
the code quality, I still believe that research should be rigorous, which 
implies that people should pay attention to the code quality. Only in this 
way can we make the research results stable and convincing. Perhaps the 
ugly code works, but I believe that at least in some corner cases, details 
can play an important rule in the whole system. In addition, high quality 
source code is easy to understand, which can speed up research projects 
based on that source code.</p>
