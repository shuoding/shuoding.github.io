		<p><strong>Name:</strong> Shuo Ding</p>
		<p><strong>Email:</strong> sdingcn@outlook.com</p>
		<p><strong>Last Update:</strong> February 5, 2020 (Time in Atlanta)</p>
		<p><strong>Research Interests:</strong> Type Theory and Type Systems, Static Program Analysis, Logic and Verification</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I believe sound, precise, and efficient static checking techniques (type systems, static program analysis, etc.) are effective in producing reliable programs. We still need to trust the specifications and the static checking techniques, though.</li>
			<li>I'm also intersted in the foundations of mathematics, such as set theory, classical logic and constructive logic, etc. I think formal methods might be widely used in the verification of mathematical proofs in the future.</li>
			<li>Industrial influence is also important, although PL research might affect the industry 10 or more years from now.</li>
			<li>I enjoy working with the Coq proof assistant and strongly typed functional programming languages like Haskell.</li>
			<li>I will also keep being open-minded, which means that I'm always interested in trying new things.</li>
