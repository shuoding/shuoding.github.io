    <h2>Name: Shuo Ding</h2>
    <h2>Academic Background</h2>
    <p><strong>Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics (Honors Program)</strong></p>

    <p>GPA: 3.83/4.3</p>
    <p>Thesis: Research on Problems in Hypergraph Decompositions</p>
    <p><strong>Master of Science in Computer Science</strong></p>
    <p>2018 - 2020 (expected), Georgia Institute of Technology, USA</p>

    <p>Completed Important Courses: Computability & Algorithms, Compilers & Interpreters, Advanced Operating Systems, Computer Networking I, High Performance Computer Architecture, Advanced Software Engineering</p>
    <h2>Interests in Computer Science</h2>
    <p>I'm widely interested in compilers and programming languages, and I'm particularly interested in the intersection of programming languages and mathematics (such as abstract algebra, combinatorics, mathematical logic, etc.).</p>
    <p><strong>The Construction of Compilers and Interpreters</strong></p>
    <p>I'm interested in the front-end and the middle-end of compilers. Although today we have parser generators, I'm still interested in parsing techniques and automata theory.</p>
    <p><strong>Static Program Analysis</strong></p>
    <p>I know basic concepts in static programming analysis, including lattices and the fixed-point theorem. I have completed a compiler middle-end with the feature of reaching definition analysis in the Compilers and Interpreters course.</p>
    <p><strong>Functional Programming Languages</strong></p>
    <p>I'm interested in the design and implementation of functional programming languages. I'm familiar with Haskell, and I know the basic syntax of Scheme.</p>
    <p><strong>Type Systems</strong></p>
    <p>Currently, I only have an intuitive understanding of this area.</p>
    <h2>Miscellaneous Experiences</h2>
