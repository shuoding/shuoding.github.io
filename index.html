    <h2>Research Interests in Computer Science</h2>
    <p>I'm widely interested in the area of programming languages, including compilers and interpreters, static program analysis, functional programming, type theory and type systems, etc.</p>
    <p>Comparing to practical things, I'm more interested in theoretical things.</p>
    <p>I'm also interested in several branches of mathematics, such as mathematical logic, abstract algebra, category theory, combinatorics, etc. Those branches of mathematics are related to some aspects of programming languages.</p>

    <h2>Selected Projects in Computer Science</h2>
    <h3>Star-Net (Written in Python)</h3>
    <p>Designed and implemented a reliable peer-to-peer communication protocol that can dynamically form a hub-and-spoke network based on UDP</p>
    <h3>Interpreter (Written in Haskell)</h3>
    <p>Designed a dynamically-typed functional programming language supporting integer arithmetic, function definitions and function calls with lexical scoping, recursive functions, higher order functions, the pair data structure, and basic integer input and output</p>
    <p>Implemented that programming language in Haskell as an interpreter</p>
