  <h1>Experiments In The System Area</h1>
  <p>Recently I discovered that people performs many experiments in the system area of computer science.</p>
  <p>I think experiments are necessary, but they should not dominate this area. Smart thought is the most important thing in almost every area.</p>
  <p>I also noticed that some open source projects that originated from the academia are really bad. Sometimes it is very hard to run those programs, because of some weird dependencies. In addition, what typically happens is that they were used to produce desired results in some paper, but they are not actively maintained now.</p>
