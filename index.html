        <h3>Georgia Institute of Technology, USA</h3>
        <p>Master of Science in Computer Science, August 2018 - December 2019</p>
        <h3>Xi'an Jiaotong University, China</h3>

        <h2>Research Interests and General Thoughts</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Type Theory and Type Systems</li>
		<li>Static Program Analysis</li>
		<li>Logic and Verification</li>
		<li>Semantics</li>
		<li>Foundations of Mathematics</li>
	</ul>
	<hr>
	<ul>
		<li>I believe rigorous static checking techniques, such as advanced type systems and static program analysis, are really effective in producing reliable programs. We still need to rely on the correctness of the specifications and those checking techniques, though.</li>
		<li>I'm also interested in the foundations of mathematics, such as topics in set theory, classical logic and constructive logic, etc. I think formal methods might be widely used in the verification of mathematical proofs in the future.</li>
		<li>Industrial influence is also important, although PL research might affect the industry 10 or more years from now.</li>
		<li>I enjoy working with the Coq proof assistant, and I particularly like writing code in strongly typed functional programming languages like Haskell.</li>
		<li>I will also keep being open-minded, which means that I'm always interested in trying new things.</li>
