  <h1>Experiments In The System Area</h1>
  <p>Recently I discovered that people perform many experiments in the system research area of computer science.</p>
  <p>I agree that experiments are necessary, but they should not dominate this area. Smart thought is the most important thing in almost every area.</p>
  <p>I also noticed that some open source projects originated from the academia are really bad. Sometimes it is even difficult to run those programs due to some weird dependencies. In addition, what typically happens is that they were used to produce desired results in some paper, but they are not actively maintained now.</p>
  <p>I think we should use high quality code in research, such as code from the industry. Using industry level code can not only produce concrete results, but also let the reproduction easy.</p>
  <p>I also believe that we should reduce the number of papers published and extend the duration of research, so that we can spend more time on improving the code instead of writing some ugly things in order to submit the paper before the deadline.</p>
