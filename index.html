    <h2>Relevant Projects in Computer Science</h2>
    <h3>Formalizing Featherweight X10 using Coq (Written in Coq)</h3>
    <p>Featherweight X10 is a small parallel programming language based on the real X10 language. Its primary features are the ability to fork tasks and then await their completion in a syntactically structured manner.</p>
    <p>The goal of this project is to formalize Featherweight X10. Specifically, we will define inductive types representing the syntax of FX10 and binary relations encoding the steps-to semantics, and prove a progress theorem, which implies the absence of deadlocks.</p>
    <h3>Uniform Program Generation (Written in C++)</h3>
    <p>Implemented a program generator that can generate programs based on the context free grammar</p>
    <p>Programs are generated uniformly, meaning that the generator can analyze the grammar and adjust the generation process accordingly.</p>
    <h3>SFPL Interpreter (Written in Haskell)</h3>
    <p>Designed a dynamically-typed functional programming language called SFPL (Small Functional Programming Language), which supports basic integer arithmetic operations, function definitions and function calls with lexical scoping, recursive functions, higher order functions, the pair data structure, and basic integer input and output</p>
    <p>Implemented SFPL in Haskell as an interpreter</p>
    <h3>Tiger Compiler (Written in Java and C++)</h3>
    <p>Implemented the main parts (lexer and parser, optimizer, instruction selection and register allocation for MIPS32) of a compiler for a simple imperative programming lanugage called Tiger.</p>
